                                our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

                            <p>If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power
                                of
                                thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including
                                our
                                financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as
                                thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?</p>
                            <p>We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
                                Prosperity
                                is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this
                                train
                                of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
                            </p>
                            <p>Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                                prosperity into your life:</p>
                            <p>Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
                                express
                                heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of
                                these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on
                                abundance, not lack.</p>
                            <p>Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
                                statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and
                                repeat
                                them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your
                                subconscious
                                mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.</p>
                            <p>Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish
                                to
                                achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same
                                way
                                affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually
                                these
                                subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous,
                                and
                                you will become so.</p>
                            <p>Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be
                                one
                                of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell
                                yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you
                                will
                                gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you
                                believe
                                you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are
                                highly
                                successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.</p>
                            <p>Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like.
                                Even
                                if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin
                                to
                                build up and attract more money.</p>
                            <p>Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such
                                that
                                we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
                                will
                                create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?</p>
                            <p>Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day.
                                But
                                over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want.
                                Once
                                you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

                                recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.</p>

                            <p>Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party.
                                Both walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and
                                unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the
                                far side because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to
                                meet acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to
                                model your business after?</p>

                            <p>Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know
                                it or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
                                competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront
                                of your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the
                                go-to people. </p>

                            <p>Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping
                                it there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
                                Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded
                                of both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a
                                catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you
                                are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although
                                this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition
                                factor is quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are
                                broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that
                                are your potential customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably
                                never will be your customers. </p>

                            <p>There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target
                                market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
                                seen by them.</p>

                            <p>Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from
                                my competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
                                yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a
                                crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
                                saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
                                budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap
                                during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television
                                promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of
                                the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t
                                seen or heard anything about them for so long.</p>

                            <p>Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for
                                the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology
                                coming down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma
                                screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters
                                becoming a thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and
                                motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an
                                option you don’t want to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is
                                required if you want to get people “in the door” of your business (or on your website
                                for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and effort up front any
                                way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target market, the
                                payoffs will be worth it.</p>
